This file contains code for both in and out of sample analysis of a json data file. In the in sample file, the in sample analysis is performed, where a hyperparameter grid is optimized for LSH and MSM performance. In OutSample, the same code is run for out of sample analysis using the obtained hyperparameters. 
I have made this code with Noah Molenaar.
