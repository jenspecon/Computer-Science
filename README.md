This file contains code for both in and out of sample analysis of a json data file in R. In the in sample file, the in sample analysis is performed, where a hyperparameter grid is optimized for LSH and MSM performance. In OutSample, the same code is run for out of sample analysis using the obtained hyperparameters. The excelFile code shows how the extra model words are defined for the excel file television brands that is used in both OutSample and InSample.
I have made this code with Noah Molenaar.
